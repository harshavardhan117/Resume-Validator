Known for non vegetarian items as well as vegetarian items. Lots of items on the menu, most of the items are of good taste. Sufficient place for parking.. always crowded. Good service, good ambience for that town. Bar is also available on the first floor of the hotel with small closed rooms good enough for small parties to gather with friends for parties. Hospitality is good, service is good, ambience is good. Crowded at parcel section as well. Got different branches in the town and both are equally good in their own terms of quality, taste, items on the menu, service and ambience. Both the localities are of within reach and one can definitely get satisfied with the taste of the food. A good family restaurant with bar availability and small party gathering rooms availability .']\n",
